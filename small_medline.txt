BTI - Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents:
      Volume 3: Final Report: Current Health Status of Test Subjects
AB  - In the spring of 1980, the Department of the Army asked the Committee on
      Toxicology of the National Research Council's Board on Toxicology and
      Environmental Health Hazards to study the possible chronic or delayed adverse
      health effects incurred by servicemen who had been exposed experimentally to
      various chemicals at the U.S. Army Laboratories, Aberdeen Proving Ground,
      Edgewood, Maryland, during 1955-1975. The Edgewood tests were conducted to learn
      how potential chemical warfare agents might affect humans over a short period and
      how such affected humans might respond to therapy for the effects of such agents.
      The Army believed that relevant information could not be obtained from animal
      experimentation alone and that it was necessary to confirm animal findings by
      using human volunteers.

BTI - Improving the Quality of Long-Term Care
AB  - Among the issues confronting America is long-term care for frail, older persons
      and others with chronic conditions and functional limitations that limit their
      ability to care for themselves. Improving the Quality of Long-Term Care takes a
      comprehensive look at the quality of care and quality of life in long-term care, 
      including nursing homes, home health agencies, residential care facilities,
      family members and a variety of others. This book describes the current state of 
      long-term care, identifying problem areas and offering recommendations for
      federal and state policymakers. Who uses long-term care? How have the
      characteristics of this population changed over time? What paths do people follow
      in long term care? The committee provides the latest information on these and
      other key questions. This book explores strengths and limitations of available
      data and research literature especially for settings other than nursing homes, on
      methods to measure, oversee, and improve the quality of long-term care. The
      committee makes recommendations on setting and enforcing standards of care,
      strengthening the caregiving workforce, reimbursement issues, and expanding the
      knowledge base to guide organizational and individual caregivers in improving the
      quality of care.

BTI - No Time To Lose: Getting More from HIV Prevention
AB  - The United States has spent two productive decades implementing a variety of
      prevention programs. While these efforts have slowed the rate of infection,
      challenges remain. The United States must refocus its efforts to contain the
      spread of HIV and AIDS in a way that would prevent as many new HIV infections as 
      possible. No Time to Lose presents the Institute of Medicine's framework for a
      national prevention strategy.

BTI - Diffusion Processes and Fertility Transition: Selected Perspectives
AB  - This volume is part of an effort to review what is known about the determinants
      of fertility transition in developing countries and to identify lessons that
      might lead to policies aimed at lowering fertility. It addresses the roles of
      diffusion processes, ideational change, social networks, and mass communications 
      in changing behavior and values, especially as related to childbearing. A new
      body of empirical research is currently emerging from studies of social networks 
      in Asia (Thailand, Taiwan, Korea), Latin America (Costa Rica), and Sub-Saharan
      Africa (Kenya, Malawi, Ghana). Given the potential significance of social
      interactions to the design of effective family planning programs in
      high-fertility settings, efforts to synthesize this emerging body of literature
      are clearly important.

BTI - Suicide Prevention and Intervention: Summary of a Workshop
AB  - For many, thoughts of suicide are abundant and frequent. There exists a fear of
      death but an even greater fear of life due to the latter's hardships.
      Participants of the committee on the Pathophysiology and Prevention of Adult and 
      Adolescent Suicide of the Institute of Medicine's workshop on suicide prevention;
      however, believe that there is potential for better suicide prevention. Two
      workshops were convened by the committee: Risk Factors for Suicide, March 14,
      2001 and Suicide Prevention and Intervention, May 14, 2001. The two workshops
      were designed to allow invited presenters to share with the committee and other
      workshop participants their particular expertise in suicide, and to discuss and
      examine the existing knowledge base. Participants of the second workshop were
      selected to represent many areas including: design and analysis of prevention
      programs, suicide contagion, and firearm availability and suicide. The committee 
      wanted to assess the science base of suicide etiology, evaluate the current
      status of suicide prevention, and examine current strategies for the study of
      suicide. Suicide Prevention and Intervention: Summary of a Workshop summarizes
      the major themes that arose during the workshop. It also includes the workshop
      agenda and a list of speakers that were present.

BTI - Innovation and Invention In Medical Devices: Workshop Summary
AB  - The objective of the workshop that is the subject of this summary report was to
      present the challenges and opportunities for medical devices as perceived by the 
      key stakeholders in the field. The agenda, and hence the summaries of the
      presentations that were made in the workshop and which are presented in this
      summary report, was organized to first examine the nature of innovation in the
      field and the social and economic infrastructure that supports such innovation.
      The next objective was to identify and discuss the greatest unmet clinical needs,
      with a futuristic view of technologies that might meet those needs. And finally, 
      consideration was given to the barriers to the application of new technologies to
      meet clinical needs.

BTI - Tools for Evaluating the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program: Phase I
      Report
AB  - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Metropolitan Medical Response
      (MMRS) program has evolved from an idea originally developed in the Washington,
      D.C., area in 1995. Using the combined personnel and equipment resources from
      Washington, D.C., Arlington County in Virginia, and Montgomery and Prince Georges
      Counties in Maryland, the Metropolitan Medical Strike Team (MMST) received
      training, equipment, and supplies specifically designed to facilitate an
      effective response to a mass-casualty terrorism incident with a weapon of mass
      destruction (WMD). The first of its kind in the civilian environment, the MMST
      was intended to be capable of providing initial, on-site emergency health,
      medical, and mental health services after a terrorist incident involving
      chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) materials. The team's mission
      includes CBR agent detection and identification, patient decontamination, triage 
      and medical treatment, emergency transportation of patients to local hospitals,
      coordination of movement of patients to more distant hospitals via the National
      Disaster Medical System (NDMS), and planning for the disposition of nonsurvivors.
      Building from the initial efforts of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area
      MMST, OEP provided funding for the development of a similar team in the city of
      Atlanta in preparation for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. The U.S. Congress has
      subsequently authorized and provided funding for additional contracts with the
      120 most populous U.S. cities. Tools for Evaluating the Metropolitan Medical
      REsponse System Program: Phase I Report identifies and develops performance
      measures and systems to assess the effectiveness of, and to identify barriers
      related to, the MMRS development process. This report identifies, recommends, and
      develops performance measures and systems to assess the effectiveness of, and
      identify barriers related to, the MMRS development process at the site,
      jurisdictional, and governmental levels.

BTI - Caffeine for the Sustainment of Mental Task Performance: Formulations for
      Military Operations
AB  - This report from the Committee on Military Nutrition Research reviews the history
      of caffeine usage, the metabolism of caffeine, and its physiological effects. The
      effects of caffeine on physical performance, cognitive function and alertness,
      and alleviation of sleep deprivation impairments are discussed in light of recent
      scientific literature. The impact of caffeine consumption on various aspects of
      health, including cardiovascular disease, reproduction, bone mineral density, and
      fluid homeostasis are reviewed. The behavioral effects of caffeine are also
      discussed, including the effect of caffeine on reaction to stress, withdrawal
      effects, and detrimental effects of high intakes. The amounts of caffeine found
      to enhance vigilance and reaction time consistently are reviewed and
      recommendations are made with respect to amounts of caffeine appropriate for
      maintaining alertness of military personnel during field operations.
      Recommendations are also provided on the need for appropriate labeling of
      caffeine-containing supplements, and education of military personnel on the use
      of these supplements. A brief review of some alternatives to caffeine is also
      provided.

BTI - Safe Passage: Astronaut Care for Exploration Missions
AB  - Safe Passage: Astronaut Care for Exploration Missions sets forth a vision for
      space medicine as it applies to deep space voyage. As space missions increase in 
      duration from months to years and extend well beyond Earth's orbit, so will the
      attendant risks of working in these extreme and isolated environmental
      conditions. Hazards to astronaut health range from greater radiation exposure and
      loss of bone and muscle density to intensified psychological stress from living
      with others in a confined space. Going beyond the body of biomedical research,
      the report examines existing space medicine clinical and behavioral research and 
      health care data and the policies attendant to them. It describes why not enough 
      is known today about the dangers of prolonged travel to enable humans to venture 
      into deep space in a safe and sane manner. The report makes a number of
      recommendations concerning NASA's structure for clinical and behavioral research,
      on the need for a comprehensive astronaut health care system and on an approach
      to communicating health and safety risks to astronauts, their families, and the
      public.

BTI - Risk Factors For Suicide: Summary of a Workshop
AB  - Thoughts of suicide can be abundant and frequent for some. These thoughts easily 
      disrupt the lives of not only the suicidal person but the world around said
      person. It may, however, be possible to tell someone is suicidal before it's too 
      late. Participants of committee on the Pathophysiology and Prevention of Adult
      and Adolescent Suicide of the Institute of Medicine's held two workshops, Risk
      Factors for Suicide, March 14, 2001 and Suicide Prevention and Intervention, May 
      14, 2001, to discuss the topic of suicide. The two workshops were designed to
      allow invited presenters to share with the committee and other workshop
      participants their particular expertise in suicide, and to discuss and examine
      the existing knowledge base. Risk Factors for Suicide: Summary of a Workshop
      summarizes the first workshop whose participants were selected to represent the
      areas of epidemiology and measurement, socio-cultural factors, biologic factors, 
      developmental factors and trauma, and psychologic factors. They were asked to
      present current and relevant knowledge in each of their expertise areas.

BTI - Adolescent Risk and Vulnerability: Concepts and Measurement
AB  - Adolescents obviously do not always act in ways that serve their own best
      interests, even as defined by them. Sometimes their perception of their own
      risks, even of survival to adulthood, is larger than the reality; in other cases,
      they underestimate the risks of particular actions or behaviors. It is possible, 
      indeed likely, that some adolescents engage in risky behaviors because of a
      perception of invulnerability-the current conventional wisdom of adults' views of
      adolescent behavior. Others, however, take risks because they feel vulnerable to 
      a point approaching hopelessness. In either case, these perceptions can prompt
      adolescents to make poor decisions that can put them at risk and leave them
      vulnerable to physical or psychological harm that may have a negative impact on
      their long-term health and viability. A small planning group was formed to
      develop a workshop on reconceptualizing adolescent risk and vulnerability. With
      funding from Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Workshop on Adolescent Risk
      and Vulnerability: Setting Priorities took place on March 13, 2001, in
      Washington, DC. The workshop's goal was to put into perspective the total burden 
      of vulnerability that adolescents face, taking advantage of the growing societal 
      concern for adolescents, the need to set priorities for meeting adolescents'
      needs, and the opportunity to apply decision-making perspectives to this critical
      area. This report summarizes the workshop.

BTI - Immunization Safety Review: Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines and Neurodevelopmental
      Disorders
AB  - In this report, the Immunization Safety Review committee examines the hypothesis 
      of whether or not the use of vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal can 
      cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), specifically autism, attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and speech or language delay. Autism is a 
      complex, severe developmental disorder characterized by impairments of social
      interaction, communication, and behavior. ADHD is a behavioral disorder
      characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity. Speech 
      or language delay refers to several disorders characterized by significant
      impairments in vocabulary and difficulty in forming sentences, comprehending
      words or sentences, or forming age-appropriate speech sounds.
