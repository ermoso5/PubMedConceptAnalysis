      Volume 3: Final Report: Current Health Status of Test Subjects
AB  - In the spring of 1980, the Department of the Army asked the Committee on
      Toxicology of the National Research Council's Board on Toxicology and
      Environmental Health Hazards to study the possible chronic or delayed adverse
      health effects incurred by servicemen who had been exposed experimentally to
      various chemicals at the U.S. Army Laboratories, Aberdeen Proving Ground,
      Edgewood, Maryland, during 1955-1975. The Edgewood tests were conducted to learn
      how potential chemical warfare agents might affect humans over a short period and
      how such affected humans might respond to therapy for the effects of such agents.
      The Army believed that relevant information could not be obtained from animal
      experimentation alone and that it was necessary to confirm animal findings by
      using human volunteers.
